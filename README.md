# Virtual Traffic Cabinet 2

Virtual Traffic Cabinet (VTC) 2 represents a notable advancement over the [original VTC framework](https://github.com/wxinix/vtc), providing an enhanced virtualization solution in modern C++20 for traffic cabinets in accordance with the NEMA-TS2 and ATC Standards. 

VTC 2 introduces a higher level of abstraction compared to its predecessor, enabling the seamless integration and manipulation of various NEMA-TS2 and ATC elements. This advanced level of abstraction empowers developers to create versatile and software-defined traffic cabinets and traffic signal controllers. By leveraging the capabilities of VTC 2, engineers can design and implement generic solutions that are adaptable to diverse traffic management scenarios.
